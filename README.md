# games-in-java

**Welcome visitors!** 

The current repository contains some well-known games and guess what... *they have been created only using java language!*
The sole purpose of these games were for me to get some hands-on knowledge in the variety of java classes present. Well, they may not be as cool as some of the modern day games like *Assassin's Creed Valhalla* or *God Of War - Ragnarok* but somewhere, these could have been the starting point of all the games we enjoy today!

Feel free to **tinker** as per your likes and contribute the knowledge to everyone who kindle their curiosity just like me!
