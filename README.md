The sole purpose of these games were for me to get some hands-on exprience and knowledge in the **ðŸ’ª of java classes**. 
Well, they may not be as cool as some of the modern day games like *Assassin's Creed Valhalla* or *God Of War - Ragnarok* but somewhere, these could have been the starting point of all the games we enjoy today!

Feel free to **tinker** as per your likes and contribute the knowledge to everyone who kindle their curiosity just like me!
