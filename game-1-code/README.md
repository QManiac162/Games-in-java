Almost every chrome user has played this game when their connection fails. 
> (*ahem* ... cursing the important downloads)

## As of now the game contains:

---
> main character: t-rex
> 
> enemy: cactus
---

While the main character doesn't change posses much besides it's leg movement indicating it's running posture along with only 2 types of cactus enemy, well this is just a basic and minimal working game. 

Though I will try to incorporate additional features to resemeble the original one, you can feel free to add enemies of your own and modify the animations pf main character to suite your liking and explore the work-abouts of the java project !

If you would like to showcase your game additions to me, feel free to do so! I'll be sure happy and excited and be inspired by **your ideas** of the game modifications !
